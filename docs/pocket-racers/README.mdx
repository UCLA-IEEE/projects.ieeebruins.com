# Pocket Racers

## Overview

Pocket Racers is the newest of IEEE projects, and aims to have students build an autonomous car driven by computer vision. Students will drive the car around a track to collect training data. The neural network will build an association from the data, and the car will be able to traverse the track on its own.

In Pocket Racers you will be able to:

- Set up and develop on the Raspberry Pi
- Understand how computers read and produce images
- Apply techniques that will make an image easier for the computer to analyze
- Clean data sets for the training, validation, and testing of your model
- Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify an image
- Optimize machine learning models
