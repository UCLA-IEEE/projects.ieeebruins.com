# Welcome

Hi there! Welcome to IEEE at UCLA's documentation for the projects we host. Our projects cover various topics such as RF, communication systems, PCB design, and computer vision. Take a look around and feel free to use these resources as inspiration for your own projects!

Our introductory project, OPS, has a dedicated website at [openproject.space](https://openproject.space/).
