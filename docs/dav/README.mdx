# DAV

## Overview

Welcome to DAV!
DAV aims to teach students the process of designing, building, and testing digital logic. Students can choose one of two tracks - the Digital Audio Visualizer track, with a capstone project involving displaying frequency levels on a VGA; and the Digital Design, Architecture, and Verification track, with a capstone project revolving around implementing a game that uses external peripherals. Along the way, students will learn about sequential logic, communication protocols, and graphics controllers. Additionally, DAV will introduce students to industry practices and prepare them for digital design and verification interviews.
